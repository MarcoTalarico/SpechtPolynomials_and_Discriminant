These are examples from S2-S5

Each folder contains a folder dedicated to the partitions, and each of those contains two files:

1) Latex: This has the matrices in tex form
2) M2:    This has the matrices in macaulay2 code

Each file has two matrices the "z" and "j" corresponding to the matrix factorizations.

to run the M2 lines first declare a ring QQ[f_1..f_n] where n is the ammount of variables:



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note to make it more compact and to fit in a page, the S5 example is done in the ring QQ[-x_2-x_3-x_4-x_5,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5] this way $f_1 = 0$ 
which makes the matrices smaller.
