Similar to the G(1,1,n) case we have 3 levels of folders:

1) Choice of G(m,1,n)

2) Choice of size of each tableaux

3) Choice of shape according to the size

Example:

I can choose G(2,1,3), if I want the matrix factorization corresponding to the shape ((1,1),(1)) then we go to 
1 - G(2,1,3)
2 - (2,1)   
3 - (1,1)x(1)

Each example has a latex and a macaulay line for both the z and j matrices.
